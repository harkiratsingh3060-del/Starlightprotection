Starlight Protection Website (Static)

Included files:
- index.html (Home)
- careers.html (Careers)

No extra CSS/JS files are required:
- Styles and JavaScript are embedded inside each HTML file.
- Images used are either embedded (base64) or loaded from the web (Unsplash).

How to host:
- Any hosting (cPanel/SFTP): upload BOTH html files to the public root folder.
- GitHub Pages: upload BOTH html files to the repo root, then enable Pages from main branch / root.

Custom domain (GitHub Pages):
- If you use GitHub Pages, keep the included CNAME file with:
  starlightprotection.com

Forms:
- The forms use mailto:, which opens the visitor’s email app.
  If you want web-form submissions without relying on the visitor’s email app, use a form backend
  (Formspree, Basin, Getform, etc.).
